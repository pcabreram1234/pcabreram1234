Hello, My name is Philip, affectionately "pocho", I am an enthusiastic learner in everything related to web development. I like to cook, chat with friends, read, study and especially the family. I currently work as a Geografica database analyst in one of the electricity distribution companies in my country. I am looking for a way to collaborate with the community and thus develop my skills and create solid collaborative relationships. My main goal right now is to be able to get a totally remote TECH job.

This is my email adress: pcabreram1234@gmail.com, it will be a pleasurte to share with you
